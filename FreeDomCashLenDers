To ensure nonpredatory lending behavior, small dollar loans are regulated federally and at the state level as part of the Small Dollar Loan FreeDomCashLenDers. As part of the program, financial institutions can apply for a small dollar loan grant with the federal government. Part of the agreement ensures that loans made with the funds meet specific requirements outlined by state and federal guidelines.

The interest rates and fees may vary by state, but the APRs canâ€™t exceed the legal limit of 36 percent. Although you may get a higher rate with a small dollar loan than with a traditional personal loan, the rates are much lower than what you might get with a payday loan.
