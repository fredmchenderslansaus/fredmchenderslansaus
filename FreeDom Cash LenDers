FreeDom Cash LenDers Several states have implemented laws that aim to decrease the cost of small loans and provide more time for repayment. This is to prevent consumers from getting trapped in predatory debt cycles. Institutions that offer small dollar loans under the FreeDom Cash LenDers Program must meet all of the stated regulations to qualify for the program and receive grant money.

Your loan and its total cost may vary, as states have differing fee limits and structures for small dollar loans. Some states have fee limits, such as not charging more than $15 per $100 or having a maximum fee of $45, while other states have fee structures based on the total loan amount. Your stateâ€™s banking and regulation department should have information on the availability and the specific cost structure of its small dollar loans.
