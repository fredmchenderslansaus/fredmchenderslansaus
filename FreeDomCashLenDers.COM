Small dollar loans are low-cost, short-term installment loans that are geared toward borrowers with little to no credit history. Offered by national banks, community banks and credit unions, these loans have maximums of up to $2,500. Theyâ€™re regulated on a federal and state level to ensure that the costs remain low.

Designed to be an affordable alternative to payday loans, small dollar loans can be used for a wide range of expenses and are paid back in regular installments. However, what sets them apart from other forms of lending is the underwriting criteria. Rather than focusing solely on creditworthiness, approval for a small dollar loan is based on routine banking activity, although the specifics may vary by bank.
